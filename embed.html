    <p>
        In his second <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/remarks/2025/01/the-inaugural-address/">inaugural
            address</a>, on 20 January 2025, President Trump declared: ‘I will, very simply, put America
        first’. This
        slogan, a mantra throughout Trump’s three electoral campaigns, suggested a focus on domestic priorities over
        international affairs. Many therefore expected a more inward-looking United States, marked by a reduced military
        presence abroad, an end to external interventions, and the <a
            href="https://www.iss.europa.eu/publications/briefs/trump-card-what-could-us-abandonment-europe-look">abandonment</a>
        of allies.
    </p>
    <p>
        Instead, foreign policy has defined Trump 2.0 so far. The US has reshaped the architecture of international
        trade,
        recalibrated relations with allies, and carried out military interventions both near home and across the globe,
        culminating in the Caracas raid that removed Nicolás <a
            href="https://www.iss.europa.eu/publications/commentary/after-maduro-future-venezuela-and-caribbean">Maduro</a>
        from power. To those who were expecting an isolationist foreign policy, even <a
            href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/08/29/trump-s-supporters-split-over-his-foreign-policy_6744837_4.html">within</a>
        the MAGA movement, this activism has come as a surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
        This analysiswill explore the main lines of action pursued by the Foreign Policy-First administration. Do the
        facts
        so far confirm or confound our assumptions about Trump 2.0? Where is US foreign policy headed next, and
        what are the implications for Europe? Can the EU still cooperate with the US or does it need to adopt
        a more assertive approach?
    </p>

    <h1>Why the focus on foreign policy?</h1>

    <p>
        Trump 2.0 has explicitly linked foreign policy action to the achievement of its domestic goals. The
        administration
        has framed the use of force in the Caribbean and the removal of Maduro as law-enforcement operations –
        complementing
        domestic measures such as mass deportations. Tariffs are presented as a necessary step to obtain external
        revenue,
        reduce taxes, encourage production within the US and create jobs for Americans. Slashing foreign aid and
        withdrawing
        from international organisations is portrayed as necessary to redirect resources towards US citizens. And
        the
        doctrine of ‘peace through strength’ is invoked to force others to stop taking advantage of the US.
    </p>
    <p>
        Trump is also using foreign policy to secure his legacy – either by obtaining the <a
            href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy7mev35x2lo">Nobel Peace Prize</a> or by physically <a
            href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/remarks/2025/01/the-inaugural-address/#:~:text=expands%20our%20territory">expanding
            the US territory</a>. He also wants to achieve goals left unfinished from his first term, such as
        reshaping trade and defence relations with allies or settling confrontations with long-standing adversaries,
        including Maduro and the Iranian regime. In short, many US actions reflect one objective: ‘finish what we
        started’.
    </p>
    <p>
        Trump’s policy-making style works particularly well in the international arena. Despite the growing
        concentration of
        power, the president faces domestic constraints. Congress, the courts and state governments can slow or block
        policies. Internationally, by contrast, Trump operates with far fewer checks. He can leverage personal
        relationships
        with world leaders and use US military and economic power to coerce or entice counterparts.
    </p>
    <p>
        This approach is working well with Trump’s base. According to a <a
            href="https://www.reaganfoundation.org/reagan-institute/centers/peace-through-strength/survey/2025-reagan-national-defense-survey">November
            2025</a> survey, almost 80% of MAGA Republicans want the US to play a leading role in global affairs, up
        from
        51% in June 2024. More recently, 74% of Republicans <a
            href="https://d3nkl3psvxxpe9.cloudfront.net/documents/U_S__Intervention_in_Venezuela_poll_results.pdf">supported</a>
        the US military action in Venezuela. Trump has thus managed to keep on board both foreign policy ‘hawks’, like
        Marco
        Rubio and <a href="https://x.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/2013645078934200810">Lindsay Graham</a>, and politicians
        focused on domestic issues, such <a
            href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/04/vance-venezuela-attack-fentanyl-00710281">JD Vance</a> and <a
            href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/words-stephen-millers-arguments-white-house-actions-us-129224664">Steven
            Miller</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Foreign policy is therefore likely to remain high on the agenda throughout Trump 2.0.

                However, in the last 12 months, the US carried out 493 military strikes. </p>

                During the entire Biden presidency (2021-24), the total was 287 strikes.

                In the entirety of Trump’s first term (2017-20), the US carried out 558 strikes. Hence, this
                administration is proving to be way more interventionist than the previous two.

                Despite the administration’s proclaimed focus on the Western Hemisphere, most US operations have

                By far the largest number of strikes (347) took place in Yemen between March and May 2025 as part of
                Operation Rough Rider, which concluded with a truce between the US and Houthi rebels. The second
                most-hit country was Somalia, with 116 strikes throughout the year, mostly targeting ISIS and Al-
                Shaabab. </p>

<p>
    One difference between Trump 2.0 and previous administrations is the former’s emphasis on a ‘shock and awe’
    approach: carrying out short but complex military raids, aiming at maximum military effect, and avoiding boots on
    the ground. Operation Midnight Hammer in Iran (22 June 2025) consisted of strikes on three nuclear facilities,
    involving 125 US aircraft – including B-2 stealth bombers that flew 21 hours from US bases – and represented the <a
        href="https://www.war.gov/Multimedia/Photos/igphoto/2003743510/#:~:text=An%20Air%20Force%20B%2D2,SHARE:">first
        operational use</a> of the GBU-57A/B Massive Ordnance Penetrator bunker-buster bomb. &nbsp;On 25 December 2026,
    the US attacked two alleged Islamic State camps in the Nigerian state of Sokoto, using more than a dozen <a
        href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/25/us/politics/trump-isis-nigeria-strike.html">Tomahawk</a> missiles as
    well as <a href="https://punchng.com/us-airstrikes-hit-terrorist-staging-bases-in-sokoto-says-fg/">MQ-9 Reaper</a>
    drones. The raid against Maduro in Venezuela (3 January 2026) <a
        href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/03/us/politics/trump-capture-maduro-venezuela.html">involved</a> 150
    aircraft launching from 20 different bases across the Western Hemisphere, as well as special operation forces and
    other assets moved to the region from other theatres.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
    Trump 2.0 has also deployed military power in new ways. The US <a
        href="https://www.iss.europa.eu/publications/commentary/warm-waters-caribbean-between-counter-narcotics-operations-and-prospects">campaign</a>
    in the Caribbean Sea and Eastern Pacific Ocean (September 2025-January 2026), which involved strikes against
    suspected drug traffickers, was part of Trump’s promise to use all means of power to crack down on crime, including
    the USS <a
        href="https://www.navy.mil/Press-Office/News-Stories/display-news/Article/4332628/gerald-r-ford-carrier-strike-group-enters-caribbean-sea/">Gerald
        Ford</a>, the world’s largest aircraft carrier. Despite its shaky legal basis and <a
        href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/10/1166234">accusations</a> of breaking international law, the campaign
    proved popular with the US public: 90% of MAGA Republicans (and 62% of US citizens) <a
        href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/12/11/maga-voters-trump-foreign-policy-poll/#:~:text=The%20Western%20Hemisphere">approved</a>
    using military force against suspected drug traffickers in Latin America.&nbsp;
</p>

<h2>The peace-business nexus</h2>

<p>
    During his inaugural address, Trump <a
        href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/remarks/2025/01/the-inaugural-address/#:~:text=%C2%A0%0AMy%20proudest%20legacy%20will%20be%20that%20of%20a%20peacemaker%20and%20unifier.%C2%A0%20That%E2%80%99s%20what%20I%20want%20to%20be%3A%20a%20peacemaker%20and%20a%20unifier.">claimed</a>:
    ‘My proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier’. He took aim at the conflicts that started during the
    Biden administration, particularly Russia’s war against Ukraine, claiming that he could end it in 24 hours.
</p>

<p>Israel and Hamas announced a ceasefire in Gaza right before Trump’s inauguration. That appeared to be an
    early diplomatic success for the President and his Special Envoy, Steve Witkoff. However, as the
    ceasefire collapsed, and efforts to end the war in Ukraine proved more difficult than anticipated,
    Washington expanded its diplomatic engagement. </p>

<p>Trump claims to have resolved eight conflicts over the course of his first year in office. </p>

                Trump is also credited with brokering an end to the Twelve Day War between Israel and Iran, after the US

<p>
    Trump’s diplomatic objectives are encapsulated in the formula ‘Realignment through peace’ (<a
        href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-National-Security-Strategy.pdf">NSS</a>, p.
    12). This wording suggests that the US could use peace deals as an opportunity to reset relations with countries,
    including long-term adversaries such as Russia – one of Trump’s stated wishes, as reflected in the substance of <a
        href="https://www.axios.com/2025/11/19/ukraine-peace-plan-trump-russia-witkoff">negotiations</a> between Witkoff
    and Kremlin envoys Dmitriev and Ushakov.
</p>
<p>
    But the realignment can also be understood in material terms: as a tool for the US to forge new business ties and
    obtain access to new resources. Several of the peace or ceasefire agreements brokered by Trump involve an explicit
    economic or business dimension. &nbsp;Ukraine, for example, signed a Critical Minerals Deal with the US in exchange
    for the resumption of US intelligence sharing and weapons deliveries. The <a
        href="https://www.iss.europa.eu/publications/commentary/you-cant-turn-trump-biden-europe-needs-new-approach-2026">28-point
        draft peace plan</a> and its <a
        href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/full-text-european-counter-proposal-us-ukraine-peace-plan-2025-11-23/">successive</a>
    counter-proposals also have economic components – such as US access to immobilised Russian assets and the creation
    of a special economic zone in the Donbas.
</p>
<p>
    The list extends beyond Ukraine. The DRC-Rwanda agreement is aptly called ‘Critical Minerals for Security and Peace
    Deal’: it establishes a regional economic integration framework for the exploitation of natural resources. &nbsp;The
    Armenia-Azerbaijan agreement &nbsp;creates a ‘Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity’ (TRIPP), an
    economic corridor. And several Southeast Asian countries signed trade and critical mineral agreements with the US on
    the occasion of the Kuala Lumpur Accord.&nbsp;
</p>

<h2>Reshaping the global trade order</h2>

<p>
    The NSS sets out a number of goals under the umbrella of ‘economic security’: &nbsp;balanced trade; secure access to
    critical supply chains and materials; the &nbsp;reindustrialisation of the US and the revival of its defence
    industrial base; energy dominance; and the preservation of US leadership in the financial sector. To achieve these
    goals, Trump 2.0 has relied primarily on two instruments: tariffs and trade deals. &nbsp;
</p>

<h3>Map: countries targeted by Trump tariffs</h3>

<p>
    The first time Trump deployed tariffs, in 2018, these were limited to a small set of countries and to specific
    products like steel and aluminium. These pale in comparison to the scope and scale of tariffs imposed in 2025.&nbsp;

                    href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2025-06063.pdf">invoked</a> the
                International Emergency Economic Power Act (IEEPA) to impose ‘reciprocal tariffs’ on imports from all
                countries not
                already subject to other sanctions or levies. The tariffs were implemented, with subsequent adjustments,
                on 7
                August. In addition, the US used the IEEPA to target China, Canada and Mexico over the fentanyl crisis,
                India for
                its purchase of Russian oil, and Brazil for alleged restrictions on free speech. The tariffs <a

            <p>
                In addition, the Trump 2.0 administration has threatened or imposed sectoral tariffs on 28 products,
                ranging from
                aluminium and steel, automotive parts and timber to agricultural products, integrated circuits, critical
                minerals
                and even foreign films.

    </div>
</div>

<p>
    In total, tariffs <a href="https://www.cato.org/ieepa">accounted</a> for USD 163.8 billion in US customs revenue in
    2025, up from USD 40 billion in 2024. The administration argues that these tariffs are <a
        href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/america-first-trade-policy/">paid</a> by foreign
    companies, and that the extra revenue could <a
        href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-tariffs-external-revenue-service/">substitute</a> for federal income
    taxes. However, according to a recent study, <a
        href="https://www.kielinstitut.de/publications/news/americas-own-goal-americans-pay-almost-entirely-for-trumps-tariffs/">96%</a>
    of the tariff burden was absorbed by US citizens: rather than increasing their unit price to remain competitive,
    foreign producers decided to export less to the US, resulting in fewer supplies for US consumers, but at the same
    price.

                EU-US trade volumes illustrate this point. Transatlantic trade rose dramatically in March 2025, as US
                firms
                increased their stocks in anticipation of the tariffs.

    Trump 2.0 has sought to replace the previous system with a new network of bilateral deals&nbsp; built around trade
    balance, access for US products and economic security . &nbsp;In 2025, the US signed 15 trade deals with partners in
    the Americas (Argentina, Ecuador, Guatemala, El Salvador), Europe (UK, EU, Switzerland and Lichtenstein), Southeast
    Asia (Malaysia, Cambodia, Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand) and Northeast Asia (Japan and South Korea). In addition,
