    <p>
        In his second <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/remarks/2025/01/the-inaugural-address/">inaugural
            address</a>, on 20 January 2025, President Trump declared: ‘I will, very simply, put America
        first’. This
        slogan, a mantra throughout Trump’s three electoral campaigns, suggested a focus on domestic priorities over
        international affairs. Many therefore expected a more inward-looking United States, marked by a reduced military
        presence abroad, an end to external interventions, and the <a
            href="https://www.iss.europa.eu/publications/briefs/trump-card-what-could-us-abandonment-europe-look">abandonment</a>
        of allies.
    </p>
    <p>
        Instead, foreign policy has defined Trump 2.0 so far. The US has reshaped the architecture of international
        trade,
        recalibrated relations with allies, and carried out military interventions both near home and across the globe,
        culminating in the Caracas raid that removed Nicolás <a
            href="https://www.iss.europa.eu/publications/commentary/after-maduro-future-venezuela-and-caribbean">Maduro</a>
        from power. To those who were expecting an isolationist foreign policy, even <a
            href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/08/29/trump-s-supporters-split-over-his-foreign-policy_6744837_4.html">within</a>
        the MAGA movement, this activism has come as a surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
        This analysiswill explore the main lines of action pursued by the Foreign Policy-First administration. Do the
        facts
        so far confirm or confound our assumptions about Trump 2.0? Where is US foreign policy headed next, and
        what are the implications for Europe? Can the EU still cooperate with the US or does it need to adopt
        a more assertive approach?
    </p>

    <h1>Why the focus on foreign policy?</h1>

    <p>
        Trump 2.0 has explicitly linked foreign policy action to the achievement of its domestic goals. The
        administration
        has framed the use of force in the Caribbean and the removal of Maduro as law-enforcement operations –
        complementing
        domestic measures such as mass deportations. Tariffs are presented as a necessary step to obtain external
        revenue,
        reduce taxes, encourage production within the US and create jobs for Americans. Slashing foreign aid and
        withdrawing
        from international organisations is portrayed as necessary to redirect resources towards US citizens. And
        the
        doctrine of ‘peace through strength’ is invoked to force others to stop taking advantage of the US.
    </p>
    <p>
        Trump is also using foreign policy to secure his legacy – either by obtaining the <a
            href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy7mev35x2lo">Nobel Peace Prize</a> or by physically <a
            href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/remarks/2025/01/the-inaugural-address/#:~:text=expands%20our%20territory">expanding
            the US territory</a>. He also wants to achieve goals left unfinished from his first term, such as
        reshaping trade and defence relations with allies or settling confrontations with long-standing adversaries,
        including Maduro and the Iranian regime. In short, many US actions reflect one objective: ‘finish what we
        started’.
    </p>
    <p>
        Trump’s policy-making style works particularly well in the international arena. Despite the growing
        concentration of
        power, the president faces domestic constraints. Congress, the courts and state governments can slow or block
        policies. Internationally, by contrast, Trump operates with far fewer checks. He can leverage personal
        relationships
        with world leaders and use US military and economic power to coerce or entice counterparts.
    </p>
    <p>
        This approach is working well with Trump’s base. According to a <a
            href="https://www.reaganfoundation.org/reagan-institute/centers/peace-through-strength/survey/2025-reagan-national-defense-survey">November
            2025</a> survey, almost 80% of MAGA Republicans want the US to play a leading role in global affairs, up
        from
        51% in June 2024. More recently, 74% of Republicans <a
            href="https://d3nkl3psvxxpe9.cloudfront.net/documents/U_S__Intervention_in_Venezuela_poll_results.pdf">supported</a>
        the US military action in Venezuela. Trump has thus managed to keep on board both foreign policy ‘hawks’, like
        Marco
        Rubio and <a href="https://x.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/2013645078934200810">Lindsay Graham</a>, and politicians
        focused on domestic issues, such <a
            href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/04/vance-venezuela-attack-fentanyl-00710281">JD Vance</a> and <a
            href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/words-stephen-millers-arguments-white-house-actions-us-129224664">Steven
            Miller</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Foreign policy is therefore likely to remain high on the agenda throughout Trump 2.0.

                However, in the last 12 months, the US carried out 493 military strikes. </p>

                During the entire Biden presidency (2021-24), the total was 287 strikes.

                In the entirety of Trump’s first term (2017-20), the US carried out 558 strikes. Hence, this
                administration is proving to be way more interventionist than the previous two.

        </div>

        <div class="card" data-step="3" data-viz="dotmap">
            <p>
                Despite the administration’s proclaimed focus on the Western Hemisphere, most US operations have
                targeted other theatres.

                By far the largest number of strikes (347) took place in Yemen between March and May 2025 as part of
                Operation Rough Rider, which concluded with a truce between the US and Houthi rebels. The second
                most-hit country was Somalia, with 116 strikes throughout the year, mostly targeting ISIS and Al-
                Shaabab. </p>

<p>
    One difference between Trump 2.0 and previous administrations is the former’s emphasis on a ‘shock and awe’
    approach: carrying out short but complex military raids, aiming at maximum military effect, and avoiding boots on
    the ground. Operation Midnight Hammer in Iran (22 June 2025) consisted of strikes on three nuclear facilities,
    involving 125 US aircraft – including B-2 stealth bombers that flew 21 hours from US bases – and represented the <a
        href="https://www.war.gov/Multimedia/Photos/igphoto/2003743510/#:~:text=An%20Air%20Force%20B%2D2,SHARE:">first
        operational use</a> of the GBU-57A/B Massive Ordnance Penetrator bunker-buster bomb. &nbsp;On 25 December 2026,
    the US attacked two alleged Islamic State camps in the Nigerian state of Sokoto, using more than a dozen <a
        href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/25/us/politics/trump-isis-nigeria-strike.html">Tomahawk</a> missiles as
    well as <a href="https://punchng.com/us-airstrikes-hit-terrorist-staging-bases-in-sokoto-says-fg/">MQ-9 Reaper</a>
    drones. The raid against Maduro in Venezuela (3 January 2026) <a
        href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/03/us/politics/trump-capture-maduro-venezuela.html">involved</a> 150
    aircraft launching from 20 different bases across the Western Hemisphere, as well as special operation forces and
    other assets moved to the region from other theatres.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
    Trump 2.0 has also deployed military power in new ways. The US <a
        href="https://www.iss.europa.eu/publications/commentary/warm-waters-caribbean-between-counter-narcotics-operations-and-prospects">campaign</a>
    in the Caribbean Sea and Eastern Pacific Ocean (September 2025-January 2026), which involved strikes against
    suspected drug traffickers, was part of Trump’s promise to use all means of power to crack down on crime, including
    the USS <a
        href="https://www.navy.mil/Press-Office/News-Stories/display-news/Article/4332628/gerald-r-ford-carrier-strike-group-enters-caribbean-sea/">Gerald
        Ford</a>, the world’s largest aircraft carrier. Despite its shaky legal basis and <a
        href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/10/1166234">accusations</a> of breaking international law, the campaign
    proved popular with the US public: 90% of MAGA Republicans (and 62% of US citizens) <a
        href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/12/11/maga-voters-trump-foreign-policy-poll/#:~:text=The%20Western%20Hemisphere">approved</a>
    using military force against suspected drug traffickers in Latin America.&nbsp;
</p>

<h2>The peace-business nexus</h2>

<p>
    During his inaugural address, Trump <a
        href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/remarks/2025/01/the-inaugural-address/#:~:text=%C2%A0%0AMy%20proudest%20legacy%20will%20be%20that%20of%20a%20peacemaker%20and%20unifier.%C2%A0%20That%E2%80%99s%20what%20I%20want%20to%20be%3A%20a%20peacemaker%20and%20a%20unifier.">claimed</a>:
    ‘My proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier’. He took aim at the conflicts that started during the
    Biden administration, particularly Russia’s war against Ukraine, claiming that he could end it in 24 hours.
</p>

<p>Israel and Hamas announced a ceasefire in Gaza right before Trump’s inauguration. That appeared to be an
    early diplomatic success for the President and his Special Envoy, Steve Witkoff. However, as the
    ceasefire collapsed, and efforts to end the war in Ukraine proved more difficult than anticipated,
    Washington expanded its diplomatic engagement. </p>

<p>Trump claims to have resolved eight conflicts over the course of his first year in office. </p>

                Trump is also credited with brokering an end to the Twelve Day War between Israel and Iran, after the US

</div>

<p>
    Trump’s diplomatic objectives are encapsulated in the formula ‘Realignment through peace’ (<a
        href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-National-Security-Strategy.pdf">NSS</a>, p.
    12). This wording suggests that the US could use peace deals as an opportunity to reset relations with countries,
    including long-term adversaries such as Russia – one of Trump’s stated wishes, as reflected in the substance of <a
        href="https://www.axios.com/2025/11/19/ukraine-peace-plan-trump-russia-witkoff">negotiations</a> between Witkoff
    and Kremlin envoys Dmitriev and Ushakov.
</p>
<p>
    But the realignment can also be understood in material terms: as a tool for the US to forge new business ties and
    obtain access to new resources. Several of the peace or ceasefire agreements brokered by Trump involve an explicit
    economic or business dimension. &nbsp;Ukraine, for example, signed a Critical Minerals Deal with the US in exchange
    for the resumption of US intelligence sharing and weapons deliveries. The <a
        href="https://www.iss.europa.eu/publications/commentary/you-cant-turn-trump-biden-europe-needs-new-approach-2026">28-point
        draft peace plan</a> and its <a
        href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/full-text-european-counter-proposal-us-ukraine-peace-plan-2025-11-23/">successive</a>
    counter-proposals also have economic components – such as US access to immobilised Russian assets and the creation
    of a special economic zone in the Donbas.
</p>
<p>
    The list extends beyond Ukraine. The DRC-Rwanda agreement is aptly called ‘Critical Minerals for Security and Peace
    Deal’: it establishes a regional economic integration framework for the exploitation of natural resources. &nbsp;The
    Armenia-Azerbaijan agreement &nbsp;creates a ‘Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity’ (TRIPP), an
    economic corridor. And several Southeast Asian countries signed trade and critical mineral agreements with the US on
    the occasion of the Kuala Lumpur Accord.&nbsp;
</p>

<h2>Reshaping the global trade order</h2>

<p>
    The NSS sets out a number of goals under the umbrella of ‘economic security’: &nbsp;balanced trade; secure access to
    critical supply chains and materials; the &nbsp;reindustrialisation of the US and the revival of its defence
    industrial base; energy dominance; and the preservation of US leadership in the financial sector. To achieve these
    goals, Trump 2.0 has relied primarily on two instruments: tariffs and trade deals. &nbsp;
</p>

<h3>Map: countries targeted by Trump tariffs</h3>

<p>
    The first time Trump deployed tariffs, in 2018, these were limited to a small set of countries and to specific
    products like steel and aluminium. These pale in comparison to the scope and scale of tariffs imposed in 2025.&nbsp;

                    href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2025-06063.pdf">invoked</a> the
                International Emergency Economic Power Act (IEEPA) to impose ‘reciprocal tariffs’ on imports from all
                countries not
                already subject to other sanctions or levies. The tariffs were implemented, with subsequent adjustments,
                on 7
                August. In addition, the US used the IEEPA to target China, Canada and Mexico over the fentanyl crisis,
                India for
                its purchase of Russian oil, and Brazil for alleged restrictions on free speech. The tariffs <a

                countries for their decision to send troops to Greenland, if implemented, would also fall under the
                IEEPA.&nbsp;

            <p>
                In addition, the Trump 2.0 administration has threatened or imposed sectoral tariffs on 28 products,
                ranging from
                aluminium and steel, automotive parts and timber to agricultural products, integrated circuits, critical
                minerals
                and even foreign films.

        <div class="card" style="opacity: 0;">
        </div>

    </div>
</div>

<p>
    In total, tariffs <a href="https://www.cato.org/ieepa">accounted</a> for USD 163.8 billion in US customs revenue in
    2025, up from USD 40 billion in 2024. The administration argues that these tariffs are <a
        href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/america-first-trade-policy/">paid</a> by foreign
    companies, and that the extra revenue could <a
        href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-tariffs-external-revenue-service/">substitute</a> for federal income
    taxes. However, according to a recent study, <a
        href="https://www.kielinstitut.de/publications/news/americas-own-goal-americans-pay-almost-entirely-for-trumps-tariffs/">96%</a>
    of the tariff burden was absorbed by US citizens: rather than increasing their unit price to remain competitive,
    foreign producers decided to export less to the US, resulting in fewer supplies for US consumers, but at the same
    price.

                EU-US trade volumes illustrate this point. Transatlantic trade rose dramatically in March 2025, as US
                firms
                increased their stocks in anticipation of the tariffs.

                Looking at the main provisions in the bilateral trade deals, we can highlight the main building blocks
                of the new trade order the US is seeking to construct.

<p>
    First, the US uses the newly imposed tariffs as bargaining tools: in exchange for tariff reductions,
    partners grant
    greater market access for US goods, commit to removing non-tariff barriers, and agree to align with US
    standards.
</p>

<p>
    Second, the trade agreements elevate economic security to a centrala objective. Washingtonuses the deals to create
    alternative supply chains which bypass China and generate new dependencies. Some agreements also include provisions
    for digital trade, including crypto assets, and support in the development of new technologies. The latter
    culminated in the <a href="https://www.state.gov/pax-silica">Pax Silica</a> Summit of 11 December 2025, which
    connects the US with a number of partners (Japan, Israel, Australia, Singapore and Korea as signatories, alongside
    the UAE, Canada and the EU as additional participants) to advance the development of a secure AI supply chain.
</p>
<p>
    Third, the US wants to address the trade imbalance. This is accomplished through ‘Buy American’ provisions, through
    which partners commit to purchasing US weapons and energy, as well as to investing in the US economy and American
    companies. This set of provisions is linked to the other goals listed in the NSS – reindustrialisation, energy and
    financial dominance.

    The year 2025 began with fears of a US <a
        href="https://www.iss.europa.eu/publications/briefs/trump-card-what-could-us-abandonment-europe-look">disengagement</a>
    from Europe. However, this withdrawal has yet to take place. Between 2024 and 2025, US troop levels in Europe
    have remained largely unchanged.
</p>
<p>
    Why has Trump not heeded calls for a <a
        href="https://www.defensepriorities.org/explainers/aligning-global-military-posture-with-us-interests/#posture-changes-in-europe-a-return-to-2014">quicker</a>
    reduction in the US presence in Europe? Most likely, NATO allies’ pledge to spend 5% on defence at the Hague Summit
    –the target Trump set at the <a
        href="https://www.euractiv.com/news/trump-says-nato-members-should-spend-5-of-gdp-on-defence/">beginning</a> of
    his second term – persuaded the President to remain committed to the alliance. European leaders and US personnel in
    Europe – such as SACEUR and EUCOM Commander, General Alexus Grynkewich, or Ambassador to NATO Mark Whitaker – may
    also have persuaded Trump to roll back these plans. In fact, the National Defense Strategy (<a
        href="https://media.defense.gov/2026/Jan/23/2003864773/-1/-1/0/2026-NATIONAL-DEFENSE-STRATEGY.PDF">NDS</a>)
    praises European allies for their commitment to the 5% spending target – putting them just below Israel on its list
    of ‘model’ allies.
</p>
<p>
    This does not mean that selective withdrawals from certain functions are not taking place. In October, the US Army
    announced that the 2nd Infantry Brigade combat team of the 101st Airborne division, due to redeploy back to the US,
    would <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/29/military-troops-romania">not be replaced</a>. In
    January 2026, the Pentagon announced plans to <a
        href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2026/01/20/trump-nato-advisory-groups/">reduce
        personnel</a> in NATO’s force structure. These could be the first steps of a shift towards ‘critical but more
    limited support from the United States’ (<a

    Europe continues to be a major purchaser of US weapons, as shown by data on <a
        href="https://www.dsca.mil/Programs/Defense-Trade-and-Arms-Transfers/Foreign-Military-Sales">Foreign Military
        Sales</a> (FMS), which account for the <a
        href="https://www.bruegel.org/sites/default/files/2025-10/PB%2027_6.pdf">vast majority</a> of US military sales.
    Over the year 2025, FMS notifications to Congress amounted to USD 104.2 billion, down from 2024 (USD 146 billion)
    but comparable to 2023 (USD 107 billion). Europe accounted for USD 38.6 billion, making it the largest purchaser of
    US defence products that year (37% of total FMS).
</p>
<p>
    However, this number represents a significant reduction from 2024 (USD 76.7 billion ) and 2023 (USD 77.7 billion).
    This may indicate the early stages of a reduced reliance on US weapons purchases, as intra-European production <a
        href="https://www.wsj.com/world/europe/europes-1-trillion-race-to-build-back-its-defense-industry-db8ca1d6">gathers

<p>
    Zooming into EU Member States provides additional suggestions that this is the case. In 2025, EU countries purchased
    USD 31.2 billion in FMS, making u for 28% of the total <a
        href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/defence-numbers/?#:~:text=2020%20and%202025-,Defence%20equipment%20procurement%C2%A0,-Spending%20on%20defence">estimated
        defence equipment investment</a> in the year (around 100 billion EUR, or 109 billion USD). This represents a
    significant drop from 2024, when FMS accounted for 50% of EU weapons purchases<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a>.
</p>
<p>
    However, individualsingle European countries still top the charts. Denmark was the largest purchaser of US weapons
    through FMS, followed by Taiwan and Israel. majorOther large European purchasers include Germany, Poland, Norway,
    the Netherlands and Ukrai’s presencenoncne. The presenceboth of Ukraine in the FMS list is significant – and
    symbolic of 2025. Kyiv, no longer able to rely on US military aid, is now a big purchaser of US weapons through FMS
    (2.4 billion USD). The country also received 4 billon USD in US weapons purchased by NATO allies through the <a

    initiative.
</p>
<p>
    European purchases are skewed towards certain categories: they spenteppurchased USD on14 billion USD in missiles
    (accounting for 57% of FMS inUSD this categoonry), 9.4 billion in air dUSD efences (67%onm), and 5.3 billion
    in command and control systems (73%). Additionally, EUSD uropeans spenton almost 5 billion USD in US combat
    aircfiguresograft and helicopters. These numbers reflect a continued <a
        href="https://www.iiss.org/publications/strategic-dossiers/progress-and-shortfalls-in-europes-defence-an-assessment/">dependency</a>
    on the US for specific capabilities such as long-range fires, air adependecnnd missile defence, C2 and ISR. This
    won’t be easily reduced until European alternatives come online.

<p>
<h1>Conclusion: Dealing with the Foreign Policy-First President</h1>
</p>
<p>
    Analysing data on Trump 2.0’s foreign policy actions is important to understand the future trajectory of the
    administration – and to calibrate Europe’s best course of action. Here are the conclusions that we can make based on
    the data.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <em><strong>Trump 2.0 will likely remain interventionist – in the Western Hemisphere and beyond</strong></em>.
        The key uncertainty is where Trump’s next military actions would focus The real question is understanding the
        likely <a
            href="https://www.iss.europa.eu/publications/commentary/venezuela-and-world-tracking-fallout-us-ousting-maduro#:~:text=The%20lesson%20for%20Latin%20America%3A%20Take%20US%20threats%20seriously">targets</a>
        of Trump’s next military adventures. With Americans from all political factions <a
            href="https://x.com/CBSNewsPoll/status/2012893674909090189">opposing</a> the use of military force to take
        over Greenland, an intervention against allies remains unlikely. Countries like Cuba or Iran are more exposed,
        as well as terrorist groups worldwide. For Europe, the concern might be less that of a direct attack, but more
        of a continued erosion of the norm of non-intervention across the globe.
    </li>
    <li>
        <em><strong>Trump’s “peace agenda” is now US policy</strong></em>. The NSS proclaims that that the US would seek
        “peace deals at the President’s direction, even in regions and countries peripheral to our immediate core
        interests” (p.12). Europe’s challenge is to steer this impulse away from short-term, transactional deals and
        towards durable, credible settlements—especially regarding Ukraine. Pushing Trump away from Putin was <a
            href="https://www.iss.europa.eu/publications/commentary/you-cant-turn-trump-biden-europe-needs-new-approach-2026">not
            very successful</a> in 2025. A new approach is needed. Europe could strengthen its independent role in
        negotiations to end Russia’s war of aggression, without relying on the US–Russia track. Beyond Ukraine, Europe
        could draw on its experience in post-conflict stabilisation to ensure that any ceasefire leads to a lasting
        peace.
    </li>
    <li>
        <em><strong>Tariffs are here to stay.</strong></em> The <a
            href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/us/politics/supreme-court-tariffs.html">Supreme Court</a> is
        reviewing the legality of Trump’s use of IEEPA to impose tariffs. If the Court strikes them down, the
        administration <a
            href="https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/insights/market-insights/market-updates/on-the-minds-of-investors/how-could-the-supreme-court-ruling-affect-tariffs/">plans</a>
        to reimpose the levies through other means, such as Sections 232 (<a
            href="https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IF13006">Trade Expansion Act of 1962</a>) and 301 (<a
            href="https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IF11346">Trade Act of 1974</a>), which are not under legal
        challenge. Hence, tariffs are likely to stay for the rest of Trump 2.0 Rather than hoping they disappear, the EU
        should adapt to the new game. One option is to make the implementation of any trade deal conditional on
        resolving other disputes – as the <a href="https://x.com/EP_Trade/status/2013986992665587811">European
            Parliament Trade Committee</a> recently did in the context of transatlantic tensions over Greenland. The EU
        should also study how countries such as <a
            href="https://www.americasquarterly.org/article/understanding-trumps-shift-on-brazil/">Brazil</a> and <a
            href="https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20250919-modi-s-firm-approach-to-punitive-us-tariffs-could-turn-the-tables-on-trump">India</a>
        suffered politically motivated tariffs, and what lessons this offers for any future confrontation with the US.
    </li>
    <li>
        <em><strong>US forces remain in Europe – for now.</strong></em> The <a
            href="https://media.defense.gov/2026/Jan/23/2003864773/-1/-1/0/2026-NATIONAL-DEFENSE-STRATEGY.PDF">NDS</a>
        states that “critical but more limited” support will remain in theatre. However, in the absence of a <a
            href="https://www.iss.europa.eu/publications/commentary/no-surprises-preparing-us-defence-strategy-and-posture-review">force
            posture review</a>, uncertainty persists over which forces may be withdrawn. The redeployment of one brigade
        from Romania could be the model for a piecemeal, gradual withdrawal – preferable to a sudden disengagement.
        However, in December 2025, the Pentagon asked Europeans to take over the majority of NATO's conventional
        deterrence capabilities by <a
            href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/us-sets-2027-deadline-europe-led-nato-defense-officials-say-2025-12-05/">2027</a>,
        a far tighter timeline. As Europeans take up greater responsibility for the continent’s defence, they need more
        clarity from Washington.
    </li>
    <li>
        <em><strong>Transatlantic vs European defence base?</strong></em> Despite the promised reduction in US support,
        the <a
            href="https://media.defense.gov/2026/Jan/23/2003864773/-1/-1/0/2026-NATIONAL-DEFENSE-STRATEGY.PDF">NDS</a>
        also pledges to promote “transatlantic defense industrial cooperation and reduce defense trade barriers” (p.
        19). This helps sustain key capabilities and avoid deterrence gaps, but it may clash with the EU’s <a
            href="https://defence-industry-space.ec.europa.eu/eu-defence-industry/white-paper-european-defence-readiness-2030_en">Readiness
            2030</a> objective of ensuring Europe can deter aggression and defend its territory across all domains.
        Managing this tension is likely to define defence industrial relations between the EU, the US and NATO in 2026
        and beyond.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Amid this uncertainty, Europe can still identify areas for cooperation with Trump 2.0. The United States remains
    willing to sell weapons to Europe, supporting near-term capability needs. As the US defence budget <a
        href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-us-military-budget-2027-should-be-15-trillion-2026-01-07/">increases</a>,
    pressure on US producers may delay European orders, but supplies are likely to continue until Europe’s defence
    industrial base reaches sufficient capacity.
</p>
<p>
    One consequence of Trump’s interventionism is that adversaries may hesitate to escalate directly against the United
    States. Ukraine exploited this dynamic by using US-provided intelligence to strike Russian <a
        href="https://www.ft.com/content/f9f42c10-3a30-4ee1-aff7-3368dd831c8c">energy</a> infrastructure. Europe can
    encourage Washington to maintain a similar approach towards Russia and to expand efforts to <a
        href="https://www.iss.europa.eu/publications/commentary/venezuela-and-world-tracking-fallout-us-ousting-maduro">seize</a>
    shadow-fleet vessels.
</p>
<p>
    There may also be scope for cooperation on economic security. The <a href="https://www.state.gov/pax-silica">Pax
        Silica</a> summit followed the US–China trade war, which underscored Beijing’s ability to impose costs on
    Washington and highlighted the value of working with partners. In this area, EU–US cooperation may appeal more to
    Trump than confrontation.
</p>
<p>
    Still, one cannot ignore that <em>the space<strong> </strong>for cooperation with the US is shrinking</em>. The
    NSS Europe’s alleged “civilizational decline” and names the European Union among “transnational bodies that
    undermine political liberty and sovereignty” (p. 25). It also promises political intervention to cultivate
    “resistance to Europe’s current trajectory within European nations” (p. 26). The outlook for 2026 is no brighter.
    Tensions over Greenland are arguably the greatest transatlantic <a
        href="https://www.ft.com/content/4b48c0d5-a4f2-410d-a482-4b988e611a6f">rift</a> to date. The most severe
    transatlantic crises under Trump 1.0 occurred in the second year, not the first.
</p>
<p>
    Europe should therefore prepare for a difficult period ahead. It has shown resilience so far—assuming full
    responsibility for support to Ukraine, countering Russian hybrid attacks, and concluding new <a
        href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_26_184">trade</a> agreements and <a
        href="https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eeas/security-and-defence-eu-and-uk-conclude-security-and-defence-partnership_en">security</a>
    partnerships with countries also targeted by Trump—while avoiding a complete rupture in transatlantic relations.
    Over the next three years of Trump 2.0, that resilience will be tested further.
