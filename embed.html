<section id="intro">
    <p> In his second <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/remarks/2025/01/the-inaugural-address/">inaugural address</a>,
        on 20 January 2025, President Trump declared: ‘I will, very simply, put America first’. This slogan, a mantra
        throughout Trump’s three electoral campaigns, suggested a focus on domestic priorities over international
        affairs. Many therefore expected a more inward-looking United States, marked by a reduced military presence
        abroad, an end to external interventions, and the <a
            href="https://www.iss.europa.eu/publications/briefs/trump-card-what-could-us-abandonment-europe-look">abandonment</a>
        of allies. </p>
    <p> Instead, foreign policy has defined Trump 2.0 so far. The US has reshaped the architecture of international
        trade, recalibrated relations with allies, and carried out military interventions both near home and across the
        globe, culminating in the Caracas raid that removed Nicolás <a
            href="https://www.iss.europa.eu/publications/commentary/after-maduro-future-venezuela-and-caribbean">Maduro</a>
        from power. To those who were expecting an isolationist foreign policy, even <a
            href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/08/29/trump-s-supporters-split-over-his-foreign-policy_6744837_4.html">within</a>
        the MAGA movement, this activism has come as a surprise. </p>
    <p> This analysis will explore the main lines of action pursued by the Foreign Policy-First administration. Do the
        facts so far confirm or confound our assumptions about Trump 2.0? Where is US foreign policy headed next, and
        what are the implications for Europe? In what areas can the EU still cooperate with the US, and in which ones
        does it need to adopt a more assertive approach? </p>
    <h1>Why the focus on foreign policy? </h1>
    <p> Trump 2.0 has explicitly linked foreign policy action to the achievement of its domestic goals. The
        administration has framed the use of force in the Caribbean and the removal of Maduro as law-enforcement
        operations – complementing domestic measures such as mass deportations. Tariffs are presented as a necessary
        step to obtain external revenue, reduce taxes, encourage production within the US and create jobs for Americans.
        Slashing foreign aid and withdrawing from international organisations is portrayed as necessary to redirect
        resources towards US citizens. And the doctrine of ‘peace through strength’ is invoked to force others to stop
        taking advantage of the US. </p>
    <p> Trump is also using foreign policy to secure his legacy – either by obtaining the <a
            href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy7mev35x2lo">Nobel Peace Prize</a> or by physically <a
            href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/remarks/2025/01/the-inaugural-address/#:~:text=expands%20our%20territory">expanding
            the US territory</a>. He also wants to achieve goals left unfinished from his first term, such as reshaping
        trade and defence relations with allies or settling confrontations with long-standing adversaries, including
        Maduro and the Iranian regime. In short, many US actions reflect one objective:<strong>‘finish what we
            started’</strong>. </p>
    <p> Trump’s policy-making style works particularly well in the international arena. Despite the growing
        concentration of power, the president faces domestic constraints. Congress, the courts and state governments can
        slow or block policies. Internationally, by contrast, Trump operates with far fewer checks. He can leverage
        personal relationships with world leaders and use US military and economic power to coerce or entice
        counterparts. </p>
    <p> This approach is working well with Trump’s base. According to a <a
            href="https://www.reaganfoundation.org/reagan-institute/centers/peace-through-strength/survey/2025-reagan-national-defense-survey">November
            2025</a> survey, almost 80% of MAGA Republicans want the US to play a leading role in global affairs, up
        from 51% in June 2024. More recently, 74% of Republicans <a
            href="https://d3nkl3psvxxpe9.cloudfront.net/documents/U_S__Intervention_in_Venezuela_poll_results.pdf">supported</a>
        the US military action in Venezuela. Trump has thus managed to keep on board both foreign policy ‘hawks’, like
        Marco Rubio and <a href="https://x.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/2013645078934200810">Lindsay Graham</a>, and
        politicians focused on domestic issues, such as <a
            href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/04/vance-venezuela-attack-fentanyl-00710281">JD Vance</a> and <a
            href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/words-stephen-millers-arguments-white-house-actions-us-129224664">Steven
            Miller</a>. </p>
    <p> Foreign policy is therefore likely to remain high on the agenda throughout Trump 2.0. </p>

    proclaims that the US should return to its ‘predisposition to non-intervention’ (p. 9). The National Defense

    January 2026 further states: ‘No longer will the Department be distracted by interventionism’.</p>

                maximise impact, and avoiding boots on the ground. Operation Midnight Hammer in Iran (22 June 2025)
                consisted of strikes on three nuclear facilities, involving 125 US aircraft – including B-2 stealth

<h2>The peace-business nexus</h2>

<p> During his inaugural address, Trump <a

    ‘My proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier’. He took aim at the conflicts that started during the
    Biden administration, particularly Russia’s war against Ukraine, claiming that he could end it in 24 hours. </p>


<p> Israel and Hamas announced a ceasefire in <a href="https://docs.un.org/en/A/79/739">Gaza</a> right before Trump’s
    inauguration. That appeared to be an early diplomatic success for the President and his Special Envoy, Steve
    Witkoff. However, as the ceasefire collapsed, and efforts to end the war in Ukraine proved more difficult than
    anticipated, Washington expanded its diplomatic engagement. </p>

        <div class="card" data-step="5" data-viz="peace">
            <p>In other areas, the US role is less obvious. Trump claims to have prevented a major escalation between

        <div class="card" data-step="6" data-viz="peace">
            <p>He has also argued that he resolved the dispute between Ethiopia and Egypt over the Grand Ethiopian
                Renaissance Dam – where tensions <a

                US brokered during Trump’s first term. </p>

        <div class="card" data-step="0" data-viz="peace">
            <p> Trump’s diplomatic objectives are encapsulated in the formula ‘Realignment through peace’ (<a
                    href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-National-Security-Strategy.pdf">NSS</a>,
                p. 12). This wording suggests that the US could use peace deals as an opportunity to reset relations
                with countries, including long-term adversaries such as Russia – one of Trump’s stated wishes, as
                reflected in the substance of <a
                    href="https://www.axios.com/2025/11/19/ukraine-peace-plan-trump-russia-witkoff">negotiations</a>

        <div class="card" data-step="8" data-viz="peace">
            <p> But the realignment can also be understood in material terms: as a tool for the US to forge new business
                ties and obtain access to new resources. Several of the peace or ceasefire agreements brokered by Trump
                involve an explicit economic or business dimension. </p>

                counter-proposals also have economic components – such as US access to immobilised Russian assets and

                and Prosperity’ (TRIPP), an economic corridor. And several Southeast Asian countries signed trade and

<h2>Reshaping the global trade order</h2>

<p> The NSS sets out a number of goals under the umbrella of ‘economic security’: balanced trade; secure access to
    critical supply chains and materials; the reindustrialisation of the US and the revival of its defence industrial
    base; energy dominance; and the preservation of US leadership in the financial sector. To achieve these goals, Trump
    2.0 has relied primarily on two instruments: tariffs and trade deals. </p>

<p> The first time Trump deployed tariffs, in 2018, these were limited to a small set of countries and to specific
    products like steel and aluminium. These pale in comparison to the scope and scale of tariffs imposed in 2025. </p>

                Emergency Economic Power Act (IEEPA) to impose ‘reciprocal tariffs’ on imports from all countries not
                already subject to other sanctions or levies. The tariffs were implemented, with subsequent adjustments,
                on 7 August. In addition, the US used the IEEPA to target China, Canada and Mexico over the fentanyl
                crisis, India for its purchase of Russian oil, and Brazil for alleged restrictions on free speech. The
                tariffs <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115911344443637897">threatened</a>
                against several European countries for their decision to send troops to Greenland, if implemented, would

            agricultural products, integrated circuits, critical minerals and even foreign films. </p>

                revenue in 2025, up from USD 40 billion in 2024. The administration argues that these tariffs are <a

                of the tariff burden was absorbed by US citizens: rather than increasing their unit price to remain
                competitive, foreign producers decided to export less to the US, resulting in fewer supplies for US
                consumers, but at the same price. </p>

                assets, and cooperation in the development of new technologies. The latter culminated in the <a

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<h2>Dealing with the Foreign Policy-First President</h2>

<p>Several conclusions emerge from the data:</p>

<ul>
    <li> <strong>Trump 2.0 is likely to remain interventionist, in the Western Hemisphere and beyond</strong>. The key
        uncertainty lies in where the next use of force might occur. Interventions against allies remain unlikely:
        widespread <a href="https://x.com/CBSNewsPoll/status/2012893674909090189">opposition</a> to military action
        against Greenland, including among Republicans, ultimately led Trump to back down. Countries such as <a
            href="https://www.iss.europa.eu/publications/commentary/venezuela-and-world-tracking-fallout-us-ousting-maduro#:~:text=The%20lesson%20for%20Latin%20America%3A%20Take%20US%20threats%20seriously">Cuba</a>
        or <a
            href="https://www.military.com/feature/2026/01/29/us-forces-headed-middle-east-tensions-iran-rise.html">Iran</a>
        remain more exposed to new military action. For Europe, the greater risk is not a direct attack but the
        continued erosion of the global <a
            href="https://www.iss.europa.eu/sites/default/files/EUISSFiles/CP_183.pdf">norm</a> of non-intervention.
    </li>
    <li> <strong>Trump’s ‘peace agenda’ is now US policy</strong>. The NSS states that the United States will pursue
        ‘peace deals at the President’s direction, even in regions and countries peripheral to our immediate core
        interests’ (p. 12). Europe’s challenge is to channel this impulse away from short-term, transactional bargains
        and towards durable settlements — above all in Ukraine. Attempts to distance Trump from Putin <a
            href="https://www.iss.europa.eu/publications/commentary/you-cant-turn-trump-biden-europe-needs-new-approach-2026">failed</a>
        in 2025, pointing to the need for a different approach, such as developing an independent role in negotiations,
        without relying on a US–Russia track. </li>
    <li> <strong>Tariffs are here to stay.</strong> Even if the <a
            href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/us/politics/supreme-court-tariffs.html">Supreme Court</a> strikes
        down Trump’s use of the IEEPA, the administration plans to reimpose tariffs under other legal authorities (such
        as Sections <a href="https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IF13006">232</a> or <a
            href="https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IF11346">301</a>). Tariffs are therefore likely to persist
        throughout Trump 2.0. The EU should adapt to this reality rather than wishing it away. It could link the
        implementation of the trade deal to progress on broader EU-US disputes. It should also learn from countries such
        as <a href="https://www.americasquarterly.org/article/understanding-trumps-shift-on-brazil/">Brazil</a> and <a
            href="https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20250919-modi-s-firm-approach-to-punitive-us-tariffs-could-turn-the-tables-on-trump">India</a>
        who have been targeted by politically motivated tariffs. </li>
    <li> <strong>US forces remain in Europe — for now. </strong>The NDS promises ‘critical but more limited’ support for
        European allies, but uncertainty persists in the absence of a <a
            href="https://www.iss.europa.eu/publications/commentary/no-surprises-preparing-us-defence-strategy-and-posture-review">force
            posture review</a>. A gradual drawdown, such as the redeployment of US troops from Romania, would be better
        than a sudden withdrawal. Yet Europe may face a tighter deadline: in December 2025, the Pentagon asked Europeans
        to take over most of NATO's conventional deterrence capabilities by <a
            href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/us-sets-2027-deadline-europe-led-nato-defense-officials-say-2025-12-05/">2027</a>.
    </li>
    <li> <strong>Defence industrial relations will test the transatlantic partnership.</strong> US calls to promote
        ‘transatlantic defense industrial cooperation and reduce defense trade barriers’ (NDS, p. 19) may clash with the
        EU’s <a
            href="https://defence-industry-space.ec.europa.eu/eu-defence-industry/white-paper-european-defence-readiness-2030_en">Readiness
            2030</a> goals. Managing this tension will shape EU–US and EU-NATO relations in the years ahead. </li>
</ul>

<p> There are still some areas for cooperation between Europe and Trump 2.0: </p>
<ul>
    <li> <strong>Defence trade</strong>: The US remains willing to sell weapons to Europe, helping to address near-term
        capability gaps – at least until the rising Pentagon <a
            href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-us-military-budget-2027-should-be-15-trillion-2026-01-07/">budget</a>
        forces industry to de-prioritise European orders. </li>
    <li> <strong>Deterrence</strong>: Trump’s interventionism seems to deter direct escalation against the United
        States, creating openings for Europe to back tougher action on Russia. Ukraine has already exploited this
        dynamic by using US-provided intelligence to strike Russian <a
            href="https://www.ft.com/content/f9f42c10-3a30-4ee1-aff7-3368dd831c8c">energy</a> infrastructure. Europe
        could encourage Washington to sustain this posture. </li>
    <li> <strong>Economic security</strong>: China’s ability to impose costs on the US in 2025 underscored the value of
        working with partners. The <a href="https://www.state.gov/pax-silica">Pax Silica</a> summit could indicate the
        beginning of a new approach. The EU should keep nudging Washington towards pragmatic economic coordination
        rather than trade confrontation. </li>
</ul>
<p> Yet one cannot ignore that <em><strong>the space for cooperation with the US is shrinking</strong></em>. The NSS
    describes Europe in terms of ‘civilizational decline’ (p. 25) and signals an intention to interfere in European
    electoral processes. Tensions over Greenland are arguably the greatest transatlantic <a
        href="https://www.ft.com/content/4b48c0d5-a4f2-410d-a482-4b988e611a6f">rift</a> to date. Deeper crises may lie
    ahead, testing Europe’s resilience and increasing the urgency to assume more responsibility for our own security.
