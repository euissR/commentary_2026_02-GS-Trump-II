<h3>US personnel in Europe over time</h3>

<p>
    The year 2025 began with fears of a US <a
        href="https://www.iss.europa.eu/publications/briefs/trump-card-what-could-us-abandonment-europe-look">disengagement</a>
    from Europe. However, this withdrawal has yet to take place. Between 2024 and 2025, US troop levels in Europe
    have remained largely unchanged.
</p>
<p>
    Why has Trump not heeded calls for a <a
        href="https://www.defensepriorities.org/explainers/aligning-global-military-posture-with-us-interests/#posture-changes-in-europe-a-return-to-2014">quicker</a>
    reduction in the US presence in Europe? Most likely, NATO allies’ pledge to spend 5% on defence at the Hague Summit
    –the target Trump set at the <a
        href="https://www.euractiv.com/news/trump-says-nato-members-should-spend-5-of-gdp-on-defence/">beginning</a> of
    his second term – persuaded the President to remain committed to the alliance. European leaders and US personnel in
    Europe – such as SACEUR and EUCOM Commander, General Alexus Grynkewich, or Ambassador to NATO Mark Whitaker – may
    also have persuaded Trump to roll back these plans. In fact, the National Defense Strategy (<a
        href="https://media.defense.gov/2026/Jan/23/2003864773/-1/-1/0/2026-NATIONAL-DEFENSE-STRATEGY.PDF">NDS</a>)
    praises European allies for their commitment to the 5% spending target – putting them just below Israel on its list
    of ‘model’ allies.
</p>
<p>
    This does not mean that selective withdrawals from certain functions are not taking place. In October, the US Army
    announced that the 2nd Infantry Brigade combat team of the 101st Airborne division, due to redeploy back to the US,
    would <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/29/military-troops-romania">not be replaced</a>. In
    January 2026, the Pentagon announced plans to <a
        href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2026/01/20/trump-nato-advisory-groups/">reduce
        personnel</a> in NATO’s force structure. These could be the first steps of a shift towards ‘critical but more
    limited support from the United States’ (<a
        href="https://media.defense.gov/2026/Jan/23/2003864773/-1/-1/0/2026-NATIONAL-DEFENSE-STRATEGY.PDF">NDS</a>, p.
    4).

<p>
    Europe continues to be a major purchaser of US weapons, as shown by data on <a
        href="https://www.dsca.mil/Programs/Defense-Trade-and-Arms-Transfers/Foreign-Military-Sales">Foreign Military
        Sales</a> (FMS), which account for the <a
        href="https://www.bruegel.org/sites/default/files/2025-10/PB%2027_6.pdf">vast majority</a> of US military sales.
    Over the year 2025, FMS notifications to Congress amounted to USD 104.2 billion, down from 2024 (USD 146 billion)
    but comparable to 2023 (USD 107 billion). Europe accounted for USD 38.6 billion, making it the largest purchaser of
    US defence products that year (37% of total FMS).
</p>
<p>
    However, this number represents a significant reduction from 2024 (USD 76.7 billion ) and 2023 (USD 77.7 billion).
    This may indicate the early stages of a reduced reliance on US weapons purchases, as intra-European production <a
        href="https://www.wsj.com/world/europe/europes-1-trillion-race-to-build-back-its-defense-industry-db8ca1d6">gathers
        pace</a>.
</p>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
    Zooming into EU Member States provides additional suggestions that this is the case. In 2025, EU countries purchased
    USD 31.2 billion in FMS, making u for 28% of the total <a
        href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/defence-numbers/?#:~:text=2020%20and%202025-,Defence%20equipment%20procurement%C2%A0,-Spending%20on%20defence">estimated
        defence equipment investment</a> in the year (around 100 billion EUR, or 109 billion USD). This represents a
    significant drop from 2024, when FMS accounted for 50% of EU weapons purchases<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a>.
</p>
<p>
    However, individualsingle European countries still top the charts. Denmark was the largest purchaser of US weapons
    through FMS, followed by Taiwan and Israel. majorOther large European purchasers include Germany, Poland, Norway,
    the Netherlands and Ukrai’s presencenoncne. The presenceboth of Ukraine in the FMS list is significant – and
    symbolic of 2025. Kyiv, no longer able to rely on US military aid, is now a big purchaser of US weapons through FMS
    (2.4 billion USD). The country also received 4 billon USD in US weapons purchased by NATO allies through the <a
        href="https://www.nato.int/en/news-and-events/articles/news/2025/12/10/nato-allies-and-partners-fund-over-4-billion-in-purl-packages-for-ukraine">PURL</a>
    initiative.
</p>
<p>
    European purchases are skewed towards certain categories: they spenteppurchased USD on14 billion USD in missiles
    (accounting for 57% of FMS inUSD this categoonry), 9.4 billion in air dUSD efences (67%onm), and 5.3 billion
    in command and control systems (73%). Additionally, EUSD uropeans spenton almost 5 billion USD in US combat
    aircfiguresograft and helicopters. These numbers reflect a continued <a
        href="https://www.iiss.org/publications/strategic-dossiers/progress-and-shortfalls-in-europes-defence-an-assessment/">dependency</a>
    on the US for specific capabilities such as long-range fires, air adependecnnd missile defence, C2 and ISR. This
    won’t be easily reduced until European alternatives come online.

<h1>Conclusion: Dealing with the Foreign Policy-First President</h1>
</p>
<p>
    Analysing data on Trump 2.0’s foreign policy actions is important to understand the future trajectory of the
    administration – and to calibrate Europe’s best course of action. Here are the conclusions that we can make based on
    the data.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <em><strong>Trump 2.0 will likely remain interventionist – in the Western Hemisphere and beyond</strong></em>.
        The key uncertainty is where Trump’s next military actions would focus The real question is understanding the
        likely <a
            href="https://www.iss.europa.eu/publications/commentary/venezuela-and-world-tracking-fallout-us-ousting-maduro#:~:text=The%20lesson%20for%20Latin%20America%3A%20Take%20US%20threats%20seriously">targets</a>
        of Trump’s next military adventures. With Americans from all political factions <a
            href="https://x.com/CBSNewsPoll/status/2012893674909090189">opposing</a> the use of military force to take
        over Greenland, an intervention against allies remains unlikely. Countries like Cuba or Iran are more exposed,
        as well as terrorist groups worldwide. For Europe, the concern might be less that of a direct attack, but more
        of a continued erosion of the norm of non-intervention across the globe.
    </li>
    <li>
        <em><strong>Trump’s “peace agenda” is now US policy</strong></em>. The NSS proclaims that that the US would seek
        “peace deals at the President’s direction, even in regions and countries peripheral to our immediate core
        interests” (p.12). Europe’s challenge is to steer this impulse away from short-term, transactional deals and
        towards durable, credible settlements—especially regarding Ukraine. Pushing Trump away from Putin was <a
            href="https://www.iss.europa.eu/publications/commentary/you-cant-turn-trump-biden-europe-needs-new-approach-2026">not
            very successful</a> in 2025. A new approach is needed. Europe could strengthen its independent role in
        negotiations to end Russia’s war of aggression, without relying on the US–Russia track. Beyond Ukraine, Europe
        could draw on its experience in post-conflict stabilisation to ensure that any ceasefire leads to a lasting
        peace.
    </li>
    <li>
        <em><strong>Tariffs are here to stay.</strong></em> The <a
            href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/us/politics/supreme-court-tariffs.html">Supreme Court</a> is
        reviewing the legality of Trump’s use of IEEPA to impose tariffs. If the Court strikes them down, the
        administration <a
            href="https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/insights/market-insights/market-updates/on-the-minds-of-investors/how-could-the-supreme-court-ruling-affect-tariffs/">plans</a>
        to reimpose the levies through other means, such as Sections 232 (<a
            href="https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IF13006">Trade Expansion Act of 1962</a>) and 301 (<a
            href="https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IF11346">Trade Act of 1974</a>), which are not under legal
        challenge. Hence, tariffs are likely to stay for the rest of Trump 2.0 Rather than hoping they disappear, the EU
        should adapt to the new game. One option is to make the implementation of any trade deal conditional on
        resolving other disputes – as the <a href="https://x.com/EP_Trade/status/2013986992665587811">European
            Parliament Trade Committee</a> recently did in the context of transatlantic tensions over Greenland. The EU
        should also study how countries such as <a
            href="https://www.americasquarterly.org/article/understanding-trumps-shift-on-brazil/">Brazil</a> and <a
            href="https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20250919-modi-s-firm-approach-to-punitive-us-tariffs-could-turn-the-tables-on-trump">India</a>
        suffered politically motivated tariffs, and what lessons this offers for any future confrontation with the US.
    </li>
    <li>
        <em><strong>US forces remain in Europe – for now.</strong></em> The <a
            href="https://media.defense.gov/2026/Jan/23/2003864773/-1/-1/0/2026-NATIONAL-DEFENSE-STRATEGY.PDF">NDS</a>
        states that “critical but more limited” support will remain in theatre. However, in the absence of a <a
            href="https://www.iss.europa.eu/publications/commentary/no-surprises-preparing-us-defence-strategy-and-posture-review">force
            posture review</a>, uncertainty persists over which forces may be withdrawn. The redeployment of one brigade
        from Romania could be the model for a piecemeal, gradual withdrawal – preferable to a sudden disengagement.
        However, in December 2025, the Pentagon asked Europeans to take over the majority of NATO's conventional
        deterrence capabilities by <a
            href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/us-sets-2027-deadline-europe-led-nato-defense-officials-say-2025-12-05/">2027</a>,
        a far tighter timeline. As Europeans take up greater responsibility for the continent’s defence, they need more
        clarity from Washington.
    </li>
    <li>
        <em><strong>Transatlantic vs European defence base?</strong></em> Despite the promised reduction in US support,
        the <a
            href="https://media.defense.gov/2026/Jan/23/2003864773/-1/-1/0/2026-NATIONAL-DEFENSE-STRATEGY.PDF">NDS</a>
        also pledges to promote “transatlantic defense industrial cooperation and reduce defense trade barriers” (p.
        19). This helps sustain key capabilities and avoid deterrence gaps, but it may clash with the EU’s <a
            href="https://defence-industry-space.ec.europa.eu/eu-defence-industry/white-paper-european-defence-readiness-2030_en">Readiness
            2030</a> objective of ensuring Europe can deter aggression and defend its territory across all domains.
        Managing this tension is likely to define defence industrial relations between the EU, the US and NATO in 2026
        and beyond.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Amid this uncertainty, Europe can still identify areas for cooperation with Trump 2.0. The United States remains
    willing to sell weapons to Europe, supporting near-term capability needs. As the US defence budget <a
        href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-us-military-budget-2027-should-be-15-trillion-2026-01-07/">increases</a>,
    pressure on US producers may delay European orders, but supplies are likely to continue until Europe’s defence
    industrial base reaches sufficient capacity.
</p>
<p>
    One consequence of Trump’s interventionism is that adversaries may hesitate to escalate directly against the United
    States. Ukraine exploited this dynamic by using US-provided intelligence to strike Russian <a
        href="https://www.ft.com/content/f9f42c10-3a30-4ee1-aff7-3368dd831c8c">energy</a> infrastructure. Europe can
    encourage Washington to maintain a similar approach towards Russia and to expand efforts to <a
        href="https://www.iss.europa.eu/publications/commentary/venezuela-and-world-tracking-fallout-us-ousting-maduro">seize</a>
    shadow-fleet vessels.
</p>
<p>
    There may also be scope for cooperation on economic security. The <a href="https://www.state.gov/pax-silica">Pax
        Silica</a> summit followed the US–China trade war, which underscored Beijing’s ability to impose costs on
    Washington and highlighted the value of working with partners. In this area, EU–US cooperation may appeal more to
    Trump than confrontation.
</p>
<p>
    Still, one cannot ignore that <em>the space<strong> </strong>for cooperation with the US is shrinking</em>. The
    NSS Europe’s alleged “civilizational decline” and names the European Union among “transnational bodies that
    undermine political liberty and sovereignty” (p. 25). It also promises political intervention to cultivate
    “resistance to Europe’s current trajectory within European nations” (p. 26). The outlook for 2026 is no brighter.
    Tensions over Greenland are arguably the greatest transatlantic <a
        href="https://www.ft.com/content/4b48c0d5-a4f2-410d-a482-4b988e611a6f">rift</a> to date. The most severe
    transatlantic crises under Trump 1.0 occurred in the second year, not the first.
</p>
<p>
    Europe should therefore prepare for a difficult period ahead. It has shown resilience so far—assuming full
    responsibility for support to Ukraine, countering Russian hybrid attacks, and concluding new <a
        href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_26_184">trade</a> agreements and <a
        href="https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eeas/security-and-defence-eu-and-uk-conclude-security-and-defence-partnership_en">security</a>
    partnerships with countries also targeted by Trump—while avoiding a complete rupture in transatlantic relations.
    Over the next three years of Trump 2.0, that resilience will be tested further.
